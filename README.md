# This is a personal budget management web application (BudgetGram)

 - It's supposed to be simple, and easy to use

## Idea
 - I developed this project to solve problems with my personal expenses

## Usage
 - To run this locally on you computer you need to run "pip install -r requirements.txt" from the project directory
 - Then you need to run "python manage.py runserver"

    ### Static files
    - There are only css static files here, and I am using tailwind css.
    - So to generate tailwind classes you need node.js installed on you system, and run npm install" command.
    - Then in the project directory, you need to run "npm run watch:css" command, to continueosly generate classes as you save the html files.
    - You can also checkout tailwind.config.js for more customization, or just visit tailwind documentation
